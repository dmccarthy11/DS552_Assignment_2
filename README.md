# Naive Bayes vs Logistic Regression

## Dillon McCarthy

## Overview
In this project, we explore the **Penguins dataset**, focusing on two species: **Adelie** and **Gentoo**. The objective is to compare the performance of two classification models:
- **Naive Bayes (Generative Model)**
- **Logistic Regression (Discriminative Model)**

We use these models to classify penguins into one of the two species based on various features, such as:
- Bill length
- Bill depth
- Flipper length
- Body mass
- Sex

The goal is to evaluate and compare the performance of these models using common classification metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, ROC AUC score and lift and gain graphs.

## MNIST Dataset
To further compare the performance of the two classification models, we expand the analysis to a multiclass continuous problem to investigate the advantages and disadvanges of generative and discriminative models.

This dataset is commonly available for download and is not included in this repository.

## Requirements
This project requires the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

## Installation
You can install the required libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
